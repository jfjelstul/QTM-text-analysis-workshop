# QTM Text Analysis Workshop

This repository contains the replication materials for my text analysis workshop at the Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods (QTM) at Emory University. 

# Workshop Description

Participants will need basic familiarity with R, including how to open and write an R script and how to work with data frames. The workshop will be interactive and participants should bring a laptop with an up-to-date version of R installed.

This workshop will cover the basics of working with text data in R. We'll cover how to import and export text data in various formats, including CSV and HTML. We'll also cover the Twitter API. We'll explore how to implement a variety of text analsyis tools, including regular expressions, making corpuses and document term matrixes, cosine similarity, hierarchical clustering,  K-means clustering, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and more. We'll conclude with applied examples that use text analysis tools to create a map and a network visualization.
